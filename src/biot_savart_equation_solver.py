        Solve the Biot–Savart equation to compute the magnetic field given an electric current field.

        Parameters
        ----------
        electric_current : VectorField
            A vector field I : ℝ² → ℝ³ ; (x, y) → (I_x(x, y), I_y(x, y), I_z(x, y)), where I_x(x, y), I_y(x, y) and
            I_z(x, y) are the 3 components of the electric current vector at a given point (x, y) in space. Note that
            I_z = 0 is always True in our 2D world.

        Returns
        -------
        magnetic_field : VectorField
            A vector field B : ℝ² → ℝ³ ; (x, y) → (B_x(x, y), B_y(x, y), B_z(x, y)), where B_x(x, y), B_y(x, y) and
            B_z(x, y) are the 3 components of the magnetic vector at a given point (x, y) in space. Note that
            B_x = B_y = 0 is always True in our 2D world.
